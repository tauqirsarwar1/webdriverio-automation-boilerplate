## Requirements
- A preconfigured Selenium Grid, preinstalled browser driver or cloud provider account

## Quick start

Choose one of the following options:

1. Install the dependencies (`npm install`)


# How to write a test

Tests are written in [Gherkin syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/)
that means that you write down what's supposed to happen in a real language. All test files are located in
`./src/features/*` and have the file ending `.feature`. You will already find some test files in that
directory. They should demonstrate, how tests could look like. Just create a new file and write your first
test.

__myFirstTest.feature__
```gherkin
Feature:
 User Sign Up
 User Sign In

Scenario: Check title of website after search
    Given I open the url "http://google.com"
    When I set "WebdriverIO" to the inputfield "#lst-ib"
    And I press "Enter"
    Then I expect that the title is "WebdriverIO - Google Search"

Scenario: Another test
    Given ...

```

This test opens the browser and navigates them to google.com to check if the title contains the search
query after doing a search. As you can see, it is pretty simple and understandable for everyone.

# How to run the test

Start the local web server:


_please note_ The WDIO runner uses the configuration file `wdio.local.conf.js` by default and 
wdio.browserstack.conf.js.

# Configurations

## Environment-specific configurations

You can setup multiple configs for specific environments. Let's say you want to have a different `baseUrl` for
your local and pre-deploy tests. Use the `wdio.conf.js` to set all general configs (like mochaOpts) that don't change.
They act as default values. For each different environment you can create a new config with the following name
scheme:

```txt
wdio.<ENVIRONMENT>.conf.js
```

Now you can create a specific config for your pre-deploy tests:

__wdio.local.conf.js__
```js
var config = require('./wdio.local.conf.js').config;

config.baseUrl = 'http://selectstar.com'

exports.config = config;
```

Your environment-specific config file will get merged into the default config file and overwrites the values you set.
To run a test in a specific environment just add the desired configuration file as the first parameter:


# Running single feature
Sometimes it's useful to only execute a single feature file, to do so use the following command:

```sh
$ npx wdio wdio.conf.js --spec ./test/features/select.feature
```


# Using tags

If you want to run only specific tests you can mark your features with tags. These tags will be placed before each feature like so:

```gherkin
@Tag
Feature: ...
```

To run only the tests with specific tag(s) use the `--cucumberOpts.tagExpression=` parameter like so:

```sh
$ npx wdio wdio.conf.js --cucumberOpts.tagExpression='@Tag or @AnotherTag'
```

For more tag options please see the [Cucumber.js documentation](https://docs.cucumber.io/tag-expressions/)

# Pending test

If you have failing or unimplemented tests you can mark them as "Pending" so they will get skipped.

```gherkin
// skip whole feature file
@Pending
Feature: ...

// only skip a single scenario
@Pending
Scenario: ...
```

# Adding new steps and snippets

The predefined snippets allow you to do a lot of common things but you might need extra snippets which
are better aligned with your aims. To do so you will find all step definitions in `./src/steps`. They
are separated in `given`, `when` and `then`.

You define your snippet using regular expressions. This is pretty powerful as it allows you to create complex
sentences with multiple options. Everything that's within `"([^"]*)?"` gets captured and appended to the
callback. The last argument is always a callback function that you need to call when your step is done.
You can access the browser and your WebdriverIO instance with `browser`.

# Comments

- You can add additional descriptive comments in your feature files.
- Added Allure reporting support

```gherkin
###
  This is a
  block comment
###
Feature: As a bystander
    I can watch bottles falling from a wall
    So that I can be mildly amused

# This is a single line comment
Scenario: check if username is present
    Given I login as "roboter" with password "test123"
    Then the username "roboter" should be present in the header
```
